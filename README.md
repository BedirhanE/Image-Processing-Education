# Image-Processing-Education

### 1. Image Processing Libraries:
OpenCV: The most popular image processing library, supporting operations such as object detection, filtering, morphological operations, and more.
PIL (Pillow): Used for image manipulation, providing basic image processing functions.

### 2. Image Representation and Processing:
Images are represented as matrices of pixels. Colored images are often represented with three separate matrices in the RGB format.
Matrix manipulation and the use of the NumPy library.

### 3. Image Filtering:
Filters are used to emphasize or hide specific features in an image.
Example filters: Gaussian, Sobel, Median.

### 4. Histogram Processing:
Adjusting contrast and brightness by analyzing pixel intensities in the image.
Histogram equalization.

### 5. Morphological Operations:
Used to change the shape and structure of objects in an image.
Operations like erosion, dilation, opening, and closing.

### 6. Object Detection:
Detection of objects using algorithms like YOLO (You Only Look Once), SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector), Faster R-CNN.
Integration with libraries like OpenCV and TensorFlow.

### 7. Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning:
Using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) architectures for image classification, object detection, and segmentation.
Deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

### 8. Image Processing Applications:
Medical imaging, face recognition, applications in the automotive industry for autonomous vehicles, and security systems.

### 9. Projects and Applications:
Developing personal projects to gain practical skills.

Examples include face recognition, digit recognition, or color detection applications.
Image processing with Python covers a broad range of topics, and there are many applications in various fields. Starting from the basics, practicing through projects, and advancing to more complex topics will help enhance your skills in this area.
